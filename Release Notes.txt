Device Master Table Change
===============
* Device Master Table -> drilldown Changed -> now it always leads to Asset Intelligence dashboard.


TODOs & Notes
==================
# DONE - for time_ip_lookup (from all searches with now()) there should be a field called indextime which should be used to get last 69 minutes added data in the lookup from where condition to avoid any issues of missing data.
# DONE - give proper name to time_ip_lookup and other lookups
# DONE - update qualys query to add fqdns, sophos add more fields so that we can use lookup for anything later, etc.
# NA ? - update all searches to use prefix for fields to avoid conflict while merging
# DONE - write savedsearches for all (execution one after other)
# DONE - test above command's logic (if its merging right devices together and its merging devices that it should be)
# DONE - remove unnecessary logs and change logging location from logger_manager
# TODO - update debug to info mode for logger
# DONE - write device inventory query by joining all tables with device inventory table
# DONE - change device master to device inventory through-out the App
# DONE - change csv lookups to kvstore for all lookups, use key as it's unique uuid per devices
# DONE - update tenable vulnerabilities lookup
# DONE - write savedsearched for generating inventory lookup (that should execute at last)
# DONE - Provide a way to manually merge two uuids/devices from UI
# TODO - Provide a way to manually remove uuids
# TODO - manually provide way to remove hostname, mac_address for any item in the list to be consider
#        (mac address collision (ignoring some mac address) - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.howtogeek.com/228286/how-is-the-uniqueness-of-mac-addresses-enforced/amp/)
# DONE - write backfilling (-7d) searches for all
# DONE - write cleanup searches for all (more than 60d remove device)
# DONE - change device master table with new lookup
# DONE (not doing it) - change asset intelligence dashboard to be displayed in the per uuid 
#        (search based on ip/host but display rest of the page based on specific device (for all it's ips and hostnames, etc) selected from the first device inventory table)
# TODO - Update all savedsearches to add more information (ex. add different statuses from sophos data)
# TODO - update rest of the App based on new lookups
# DONE - what to do for conflicting mac_address
# TODO - update qualys and tenable -> remote fixed and info vulnerabilities

# TODO - Sophos depends on counter-measure configuration and commands for collecting inventory.
# DONE - Update above csv lookup writing to kvstore for cs_device_inventory_lookup.csv

# DONE - Logic validation Notes
# - product_uuid match scenario found - seems to be working
# - hostname search is working when product_uuid not found
#
# - mac address conflict scenario found:
#       | inputlookup cs_device_inventory_lookup.csv | search hostname="*CR-LANSWEEPER*" | table uuid, ip, hostname, mac_address, *
#       xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
#       xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
#
# - another conflict found:
#       handle_record: product_uuid: sophos_uuid, record: OrderedDict([('hostname', 'mleadc02'), ('indextime', '1623759108'), ('lansweeper_id', ''), ('time', '1623473357.840000'), ('ip', '10.10.10.6,169.254.150.167'), ('mac_address', '00:0c:29:ee:91:7e,02:00:4c:4f:4f:50'), ('sophos_uuid', 'c64b1e2d-4807-442e-ba5b-b97cf432a113'), ('qualys_id', '')])
#       Finding field:sophos_uuid, value:c64b1e2d-4807-442e-ba5b-b97cf432a113
#       Lookup entry not found.
#       product_uuid not found in the lookup
#       Finding field:hostname, value:mleadc02
#       Found lookup entry:['xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
#       hostname found in the lookup
#       data_pointer[sophos_uuid]=xxxxxxxxx-eade-480a-9d17-xxxxxxxxxxxx is already present, while adding record:OrderedDict([xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# DONE (not needed for current logic) - Auto remove mac_addresses and hostnames that is causing conflict.
#      - DONE - Or find some better solution for these conflicts as it seems conflict are more often.

# DONE - Device master table showing wrong count for sophos
#      - I think that's due to mac_address conflict



DONE (not doing it now) - Add mac_address filter on Asset Intelligence dashboard
DONE - Update device master drilldown

DONE - update csv device inventory lookup to kvstore lookup (grep)

DONE - grep master and update through out the App

TODO - Change default value for animate to "false" for cs_network_animate_pulse_traffic_map and cs_network_animate_traffic_map

Asset Intelligence Dashboard
DONE - Make drilldown from device master table appropriate
DONE - Handle multi-values properly
TODO - Add tables/lookups for everything -> change the ones that uses direct search from the asset intelligence dashboard

DONE - Use macro for common searches through-out all the dashboards

DONE - There are still mac_address and ip value that starts with ,(comma) - example -> ,xx.xx.xx.xx

TODO - For Future - Smart merge
    - If IP matches and time last updated is quite near Or similar way for Mac Address -> Then we can smartly merge it.

Note (Why can't we merge these automatically):
- IP or Mac matches but we for sure know they are different device -> https://xx.xx.xx.40:8000/en-US/app/cyences_app_for_splunk/search?q=%7C%20inputlookup%20cs_device_inventory%0A%7C%20eval%20ip_values%3Dsplit(ip%2C%20%22%2C%22)%2C%20mac_values%3Dsplit(mac_address%2C%20%22%2C%22)%0A%7C%20multireport%20%5B%0A%7C%20stats%20values(*)%20as%20*%20by%20mac_values%0A%7C%20eval%20no_uuids%3Dmvcount(uuid)%20%7C%20where%20no_uuids%3E1%20%0A%7C%20eval%20no_lansweeper%3Dmvcount(lansweeper_id)%2C%20no_qualys%3Dmvcount(qualys_id)%2C%20no_tenable%3Dmvcount(tenable_uuid)%2C%20no_sophos%3Dmvcount(sophos_uuid)%2C%20no_defender%3Dmvcount(windows_defender_host)%2C%20no_crowdstrike%3Dmvcount(crowdstrike_userid)%20%7C%20fillnull%20value%3D0%20no_lansweeper%20no_qualys%20no_tenable%20no_sophos%20no_defender%20no_crowdstrike%0A%7C%20where%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_lansweeper%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_qualys%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_tenable%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_sophos%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_defender%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_crowdstrike%0A%7C%20eval%20Type%3D%22Mac%20Address%20Matches%22%20%7C%20table%20Type%2C%20mac_values%2C%20uuid%2C%20no_uuids%2C%20hostname%2C%20ip%2C%20mac_address%2C%20lansweeper_id%2C%20qualys_id%2C%20tenable_uuid%2C%20sophos_uuid%2C%20windows_defender_host%2C%20crowdstrike_userid%5D%0A%5B%0A%7C%20stats%20values(*)%20as%20*%20by%20ip_values%0A%7C%20eval%20no_uuids%3Dmvcount(uuid)%20%7C%20where%20no_uuids%3E1%20%0A%7C%20eval%20no_lansweeper%3Dmvcount(lansweeper_id)%2C%20no_qualys%3Dmvcount(qualys_id)%2C%20no_tenable%3Dmvcount(tenable_uuid)%2C%20no_sophos%3Dmvcount(sophos_uuid)%2C%20no_defender%3Dmvcount(windows_defender_host)%2C%20no_crowdstrike%3Dmvcount(crowdstrike_userid)%20%7C%20fillnull%20value%3D0%20no_lansweeper%20no_qualys%20no_tenable%20no_sophos%20no_defender%20no_crowdstrike%0A%7C%20where%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_lansweeper%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_qualys%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_tenable%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_sophos%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_defender%20or%20no_uuids%3C%3Dno_crowdstrike%0A%7C%20eval%20Type%3D%22IP%20Matches%22%20%7C%20table%20Type%2C%20ip_values%2C%20uuid%2C%20no_uuids%2C%20hostname%2C%20ip%2C%20mac_address%2C%20lansweeper_id%2C%20qualys_id%2C%20tenable_uuid%2C%20sophos_uuid%2C%20windows_defender_host%2C%20crowdstrike_userid%5D%0A%7C%20table%20Type%2C%20ip_values%2C%20mac_values%2C%20uuid%2C%20no_uuids%2C%20hostname%2C%20ip%2C%20mac_address%2C%20lansweeper_id%2C%20qualys_id%2C%20tenable_uuid%2C%20sophos_uuid%2C%20windows_defender_host%2C%20crowdstrike_userid&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&workload_pool=&earliest=-24h%40h&latest=now&display.general.type=statistics&display.statistics.sortColumn=ip_values&sid=1624284644.866

TODO - Adding visible border to expanded table would be better.

DONE - Device Inventory Management - Add checkboxes to select uuids and add buttons for merge and never merge.
    - Show message for confirmation of merge and merge completion.


DONE - Allow merging devices which lansweeper or tenable says different device (multi-value in product id field)

Device Inventory
-----------------
TODO - Once in a while we need to completely cleanup lookups and re-generate device inventory (for future)
       to make sure we are not having old hostnames and mac_addresses tied-up.
DONE - ip addresses are being auto cleaned-up -> which is problem because we don't see Ips for lot of devices
    - now it flushes ip address only if device uuid has not been updated in last 7 days and now it updates
TODO - we need to store ip and hostname and mac with their relevant time and product (for future)
    - Some mechanism so one of the id is removed from lansweeper, we can remove ip/host and stuff related to it from device inventory table instantly as lansweeper updates the information every 2 hour.
    - In that case we don't have to look at old data and find old device information.


TODO - Reflect whole app to work with device inventory (specifically asset intelligence dashboard)
TODO - Move all searches to macros.conf so asset intelligence dashboard can keep consistency when we make change to dashboard that also changes the asset intelligence panel

TODO - replace lansweeper dashboard and combine information into device inventory dashboard (for future)
TODO - Lansweeper dashboard -> Move Hyper-v guest from Other to VMware section

DONE - Tenable dashboard > row expansion > wrap text show that there is not a lot of horizontal scrolling
     - we can actually use wrap text
     - done for Qualys as well
