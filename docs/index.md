## Overview
The Cyences App for Splunk was designed to allow users complete visibility of their system's security status. It was created with the intention of becoming a seamless piece of the Blue team arsenal for security engineers and administrators. The forensic interface based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework to quickly identify areas of concern. continuous quarterly enhancements are occurring towards achieving that goal. These updates will continue to improve tool customization and scalability with advanced search features, alerting, machine learning, and AI.

By default, the Cyences app provides a multitude of alerts and dashboards in the following categories:

* Active Directory / Azure Active Directory

Apart from alerts and dashboards, the Cyences App also integrates with some other well-known tools to create important dashboards that would add intelligence to your security investigation and auditing processes:

* Intelligence
* Device Inventory Table
* User Inventory Table
* Globally Detected Malicious IPs


How does the Cyences app differentiate itself from Enterprise Security?

For new Splunk users, Enterprise Security requires a lot of fine tuning in order to get the most optimal experience and they may have trouble doing so as there's so much to learn before even reaching that point. For example, users have to configure several correlation searches within Enterprise Security and understand how it ties into specific use cases as well. On the other hand, the Cyences app was created with having one goal in mind and that is to provide an out of the box end-to-end security solution. Meaning, Splunk users don't have to configure all that much in order to get things started right away. Additionally, the alerting feature found within the Cyences app allows users to receive alerts via Slack or by email all while keeping the false positives at a bare minimum.


Cyences has other unique first in the market features on Splunk, like Alert Digest, Device Inventory, User Inventory, Network Telemetry, etc.

* **Alert Digest and Critical Email Alert**: In Cyences 3.0.0, we introduce a better way to look at alerts from Splunk so user don't get spammed by so many alerts from Splunk and get the critical alerts immediately while keeping the inbox clean. In Cyences user can configure their email address at once and get all the critical events from all the alerts without configuring their email on all of them separately. In addition to that Cyences has an alert called Digest Alert which sends all the medium and high severity notable events from all the alerts as a digest email only once a day. Please refer to [Cyences Email Settings for Alerts]({{ site.baseurl }}/install_configure/configuration/#cyences-email-settings-for-alerts) section for configuration guide and more information.

* **Device Inventory and Intelligence**: Version 1.2.0 of the Cyences app features a new component and that is the Device Inventory Table. It is a vital tool that helps with the security audit process and requires zero configuration. The Device Inventory Table lists all of the different devices present in an environment by correlating data from CrowdStrike, Lansweeper, Kaspersky, Qualys, Sophos, Tenable, Windows Defender, etc. And there is one more dashboard called "Intelligence" which is very helpful for investigating a security incident. For more information, please refer to the [Device Inventory and Intelligence]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/intelligence_dashboard/) section for more details.

* **User Inventory**: Version 4.3.0 of the Cyences app features a new component and that is the User Inventory Table. It provides information about users in an environment and user-related metadata, such as the number of users by their type, users associated with each product, etc. For more information, please refer to the [User Inventory]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/intelligence_dashboard/) section for more details.

* **Network Telemetry**: Cyences has a dashboard called "Network Telemetry" which shows a very important information for security team. It shows if there is active traffic on a port on a machine which is vulnerable (or has known vulnerability), showing if vulnerability in your environment is actively being exploited. This is very critical information for security team.
