# Intelligence 

* Cyences introduces a new drop-down option named Intelligence in the app's navigation bar and it contains the following items:

    * Intelligence
    * Device Inventory
    * User Inventory
    * Globally Detected Malicious IPs

* The "Intelligence" dashboard has been added to the Cyences app in version 1.4.0, initially named "Asset Intelligence", later renamed to "Intelligence" in version 4.3.0.

## Globally Detected Malicious IPs

The Globally Detected Malicious IPs list is generated from a combination of dashboards, scheduled reports, and a paid service through HoneyDB's APIs. It goes into extensive detail by providing the location of the bad IP address to the last seen time. This list covers the following topics: 

* DDoS attacks on Palo Alto firewalls
* Inbound traffic from blocked IPs
* Outbound traffic to blocked IPs

If an IP address is involved in any of the above scenarios, then it will automatically be added to the list. The goal of Globally Detected Malicious IPs is to assist Splunk users to learn even more about their environment and to help identify suspicious activity in order to take the appropriate security measures to strengthen their network. Do not let your business become the next victim. For more information, please refer to the **Globally Detected Malicious IPs** dashboard.

Beginning with version 1.1.0, the Globally Detected Malicious IPs list is now being generated on the Malicious IP list server, which is deployed by CrossRealms International. This list is based on bad IP address activity that's detected in Splunk environments across all installations where Cyences is configured. This list provides Splunk users with the latest globally detected malicious IP list and stores it back into the lookup within the Cyences app. This will result in a more robust list for Splunk users to rely on. For Splunk Admins, please refer to the **Configuration of Access Token for Malicious IP List** section to learn more about the API configuration process. 

**Note**: The Malicious IP List Gen does not disclose any private information from a Splunk user's environment.

## Device Inventory

The Device Inventory dashboard contains a list of every asset or device present in an environment. 

![alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/device_inventory.png)

It is populated from a lookup which is built by scheduled reports. The lookup is generated from the following data sources (the table can still function even if one or more categories of data are not present): 

* CrowdStrike
* Lansweeper
* Qualys
* Sophos
* Tenable
* Windows Defender
* Kaspersky
* Splunk Internal Logs

The Device Inventory dashboard was built based on the above categories, but it will still be able to recognize the majority of assets or devices present in any environment. This dashboard can be a great tool to rely on during a security audit or while gathering information about assets. It can even identify if a device is not sending a particular type of data (i.e., Windows Defender). This will be incredibly useful for when security engineers are trying to gain a better understanding of something like an attack vector. Users can see the status of the device from the antivirus perspective as well.  

The Device Inventory dashboard has several drilldown options, which allows Splunk users to see the whole picture regarding any device from the "Intelligence" dashboard  

**Note**: Click on a device to perform a drilldown. 

The **Device Master Table** has been renamed to **Device Inventory Table** in version 1.6.0. Several improvements have been made, such as (refer to the Release Notes section for more information):

* It automatically merges devices based on information like hostname, MAC address, or IP address to show an accurate count of devices. 
    * Cyences intelligently merges entries that apply to the same device. 
* Assigns unique UUID to each device. 

**Note**: The remaining portion of the Device Inventory dashboard guide is meant for Administrators only.

Sometimes it is confusing for Cyences' algorithm to automatically merge two device entries together. In this case, Cyences will prompt the user to identify any device entries that can be merged together and the Splunk user will then be asked to manually merge these device entries together. This process is located in the **Possible Merge UUIDs (Devices) in Device Inventory** dashboard panel.

* Expand any row to view more information about the device entry. 
* Expanding a row will reveal the **Merge** button. 
* Device entries can be merged by using the checkboxes in the **Select** row. 
* Click **Merge** to combine the selected device entries.  
* This change will be reflected after the **Device Inventory** dashboard is refreshed.

## User Inventory

The User Inventory dashboard contains a list of users present in an environment.

![alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/user_inventory.png)

It is populated from a lookup which is built by scheduled report. The lookup is generated from all the data sources.

The User Inventory dashboard was built by scanning the user data from all the sources available in the splunk environment. This dashboard is very useful to check the user related metadata information such as number of users by its type, users associated to each products. It will showcase the list of users with their associated roles/types and products. 

The User Inventory dashboard has several drilldown options, which allows Splunk users to see the user related statistics and related logs.

**Note**: Click on a "View Related Logs" column to see the user related logs in last 24 hours. 

* It automatically merges the users based on its name. Also, It compares the user by removing the prefixes and postfixes configured in macros. 
* It assigns unique UUID to each user.

To grant the privileges to the user from **User Inventory** dashboard, navigate to the **User Inventory Table** panel.

The Cyences alerts will use this information to determine severity based on the user involved, whether they are privileged or usual.

## Intelligence Dashboard

This dashboard shows detailed information about a specific asset or device. The "Intelligence" dashboard is an extension of the Device Inventory dashboard. Splunk users can drilldown from the Device Inventory to see the complete picture about a particular device. 

This dashboard displays the following information about devices: 

* Lansweeper information 
* Host Vulnerability Summary
* Host Vulnerabilities
* Sophos + Windows Defender (Antivirus) status and related events 
* VPN activities from the device or by the selected user
* Various authentication activities like RDP and Linux logins 
* If an asset is involved in any kind of Splunk security alert

The "Intelligence" dashboard has been added to the Cyences app in version 1.4.0, initially named "Asset Intelligence", later renamed to "Intelligence" in version 4.3.0.
