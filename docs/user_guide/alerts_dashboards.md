# Alerts & Dashboards (security use-cases)

There are several security related alerts to choose from and they are all located under the **Settings** drop-down in the navigation bar (**Settings > Settings > Searches, Reports and Alerts**) of the Cyences App (alerts are disabled by default). There are also several security related dashboards to choose from and they are all located under the **Dashboards** drop-down in the navigation bar of the Cyences App. Alerts and dashboards should be reviewed regularly as they can help pinpoint any security risks that may be present in your Splunk environment. Each category contains the following alerts and dashboards (as dashboard panels):

## Network Telemetry
Cyences has a dashboard called "Network Telemetry" which shows if there is active traffic on a port on a machine which is vulnerable (or has known vulnerability detected by vulnerability scanner in your environment), showing if vulnerability in your environment is actively being exploited. This is very critical information for security team.
(Basically we correlate data from vulnerability tools like Qualys, Tenable or Nessus and correlate with Network Traffic logs from Palo Alto or Fortigate to show if the target is being actively exploited. This would have been very difficult to implement with traditional security tools.)

* Dashboard panels:
    * Port Scanning Attempts
    * Inbound Network Telemetry
    * Outbound Network Telemetry
    * Internal Traffic


## Vulnerability

* Alerts:
    * Detected New Vulnerabilities

Supported vendor products include: CrowdStrike Spotlight, Nessus, Qualys, Tenable IO, Tenable SC & Nessus:Pro

These vendor security solutions are designed to detect vulnerabilities present in your environment.

The Cyences app utilizes the data provided by the aforementioned vendor products to obtain information pertaining to any vulnerabilities that may exist on an IT asset within your environment.

The Vulnerability dashboard is designed to view the vulnerability count by severity, new vulnerabilities found over time, a vulnerability summary based on host(s), and a list of vulnerabilities. Splunk users can further use the drilldown capability to view a vulnerability list for a single host or a list of hosts affected by a vulnerability.

Dashboard panels:
* New Unique Vulnerability Found Over Time
* New Total Vulnerability Found Over Time
* Vulnerabilities
* Unique Vulnerability Count By Severity
* Total Vulnerability Count By Severity

## Lansweeper (asset management tool)
The Lansweeper dashboard is powered by Lansweeper's data [https://www.lansweeper.com](https://www.lansweeper.com). The Cyences app mainly uses this data for IT discovery and inventory. This dashboard displays information about every IT asset present in your environment. Here are some of the various types of IT assets which are acknowledged by Lansweeper: 

* Apple Macintosh 
* ESXi servers
* Hyper-V Guests
* Location
* Linux
* Monitor
* Network devices
* Other devices
* VMware Guests
* VMware vCenter services
* Web Servers
* Windows

The Lansweeper dashboard also provides information about whether the IT asset is sending useful security logs based on the type of asset. For example, Windows assets should send Sysmon, WinEventLog:Security, and WinEventLog:System logs for improved security on those assets.
