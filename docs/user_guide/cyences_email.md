## **Cyences Email Settings for Alerts**

Refer to Configuration > Installation 

The configuration process for Cyences email alert settings consist of three components. 

1. Send Digest Email - sent once a day, contains all alerts triggered in 24 hours (default - medium and high severity only; users can customize settings), only applicable to the alert that's being configured (add screenshot). **Note** Maximum of 15 notable events per alert & if there are more than 10 alerts triggered than users will receive digest emails in parts (1, 2, etc.). 

2. Cyences Action - Send Email - users won’t have to manually configure their email for every Cyences alert. They’ll be able to add their email address for each alert from a single source (Cyences Configuration page). 

3. Cyences Action - Send Email - Default/Common Configuration - Cyences configuration page to get all emails (default - critical severity; users can customize severity levels). If you want to override the settings for a particular alert, go to the individual alert and remove your email address from the Cyences Action - Send Email Exclude Recipients section. Add email address to Include Additional Recipients if you only want to receive emails for a specific alert. Mention disable email option.

* <TODO-Ahad> - add screenshot



* Up until Cyences 2.3.0, users have been able to set up an email notification for alerts via Splunk's default method, even with regular Splunk use-cases. This is not always a good idea as some alerts may contain a lot of false positives which leads to a lot of unnecessary noise. Additionally, not every alert needs to be immediately received via email.

Cyences 3.0.0 introduces two new email settings:

1. Regular Alert Digest Email
    * Sends notification about triggered notable events in the last 24 hours for every Cyences alert in a single email alert.
    * By default, the digest email will include both high and medium severity level notable events, but users can adjust the severity level as needed.
    * The alert will be sent once every day.
        * This configuration can be edited from the **Cyences Action - Send Digest Email** alert action inside of the **Cyences Digest Email** alert.

**Note:** Users may receive multiple digest emails as there is a limit of ten alerts per digest email and each alert will be limited to fifteen notable events for the total result count information.  

2. Critical Alert Email
    * Sends an immediate email whenever an alert triggers if the notable event is of critical severity.
    * Users receive an immediate notification about important items within the email.
    * Users do not have to configure their email address for every alert in order to receive critical alert emails. Users will be able to configure it through Cyences Configuration page.
        * Navigate to **Cyences App > Settings > Configuration** and add email addresses to the **Cyences Action - Send Email - Default/Common Configuration** section.
        * Users can customize the severity level for this email setting as needed.

    * Users also have an option to exclude themselves from specific alerts or include their email addresses for specific alerts.
        * This configuration can be done at the alert level by editing the **Cyences Action - Send Email** alert action for a particular alert.

**Note** Users can continue to use the default Splunk email functionality as desired and independently of the aforementioned Cyences email settings.
