# Overview Dashboard
The​​ Overview dashboard displays the overall security status of​​ the​​ Splunk environment,​​ in addition to​​ highlighting​​ present​​ security issues as well.​​ Triggered alerts will be visible in red.​​ We​​ specifically​​ designed the Overview dashboard to be a single pane of glass for ease of use.​​
