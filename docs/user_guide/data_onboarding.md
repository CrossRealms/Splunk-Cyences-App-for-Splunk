# Data Onboarding [Admin]

The Cyences App uses data from multiple add-ons and the process for collecting this data will be outlined below. 

**Note:** This data collection process does not cover an end-to-end configuration guide for third party add-ons. For any third-party add-ons, please visit their own configuration guide for complete details. 

## **Sysmon**

### Sysmon Overview

Sysmon, a component of Microsoft’s Sysinternals suite of Windows utilities, is a very powerful host-level tool that can assist in detecting advanced threats on a network by providing intricate host-operation details in real-time. In contrast to common Antivirus/Host-Based Intrusion-detection (HIDS) solutions, Sysmon performs deep monitoring on system activity and logs high-confidence indicators on advanced attacks. 

This is a fantastic way to collect detailed information about your Windows endpoints in Splunk. Sysmon is free of charge, installs painlessly on many variants of Windows, and integrates well with Splunk deployments. In fact, Mark Russinovich (Sysmon’s author) has spoken about Sysmon at the past two RSA conferences and showcases Splunk as an excellent mechanism for the collection and analysis of Sysmon data. 

### Prerequisites 
* This method will require a Splunk Heavy Forwarder or Universal Forwarder to be installed and running on the Windows server. 
* Data Forwarding is configured from the Forwarder to the Splunk Indexer(s). 

### How to Install and Configure Microsoft Sysmon with Deployment Server 

Instead of having to manually install Microsoft Sysmon on each and every Windows server in your environment, it would be optimal to install Sysmon on Windows machines via the Deployment Server (to learn more about the deployment server, click here). You can still manually install Sysmon, but that would be an exhaustive and time-consuming task if your environment contains tons of Windows servers. 

The Sysmon Deploy Add-on for Cyences App (https://github.com/VatsalJagani/Splunk-App-Sysmon-deploy-for-Cyences-App) installs and updates Sysmon on Windows machines. Also, it updates the Sysmon config file if there are any changes made to the Sysmon file. 

### Install and Maintain Sysmon on Windows Machines from deployment-server 

1. Use **Sysmon Deploy Add-on for Cyences App** to install Microsoft Sysmon on Windows machines. 

2. Download the latest Add-on build file named **TA-sysmon-deploy-for-cyences.tgz** (https://github.com/VatsalJagani/Splunk-App-Sysmon-deploy-for-Cyences-App/releases/) 

3. Extract the file under the deployment apps directory on the deployment server. 

4. Create a server class in the deployment server and deploy this Add-on to the required Windows hosts. 

5. From Cyences’ navigation bar, go to **Settings > Sysmon Deploy Audit** for Sysmon deployment, auditing, and reporting. 

6. This will start forwarding the Sysmon events to the indexer(s). Lastly, create an index named **epintel** in the indexer(s) in order to receive data. 

**Note:** The Sysmon Deploy Add-on for Cyences App generates auditing logs in index=**windows** and actual Sysmon data in index=**epintel**. Sysmon collects several types of EventCodes from the Windows hosts. For the Cyences app, we will need to incorporate the following EventCodes: 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, and 25. 

## Sysmon EventCodes:

![]()

* Enable EventCode 10 to detect credential dumping on Windows with LSASS access. Please be aware that Event Code 10 may consume a large portion of your daily license usage. 

* EventCode 25 has been added to Sysmon since version 13.0 (released in January 2021). If an earlier version of Sysmon is being used you will not be able to take advantage of the **Window Process Tampering Detected** alert. 

* Sysmon logs are only tested in XML format (see renderXml = 1 in inputs.conf stanza). 

## Verify Data Collection 

Run the search query below to verify that the data is being ingested:

    index=epintel source=”XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational” 

Currently, the idea is to use Sysmon data on Windows to get different file operations performed on the Windows hosts (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1914/). 

References: 
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon 
* https://docs.splunksecurityessentials.com/data-onboarding-guides/microsoft-sysmon/ 

**Note:** Sysmon data action field conflict detected, please look at **Troubleshooting > Sysmon data action field issue** section in the document to make sure your environment does not have the same issue.

## **Windows WinEventLog**

View the Splunk Add-on for Windows documentation to learn how to enable Security WinEventLog data (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/AbouttheSplunkAdd-onforWindows). 

Enable the input stanzas below for the Splunk Add-on for Windows. Both stanzas are located in the inputs.conf file (create a local directory if necessary): 

    [WinEventLog://Security] 
    disabled = 0 
    blacklist3 = EventCode="5156" 
    renderXml=false 
    index=windows 

    [WinEventLog://System] 
    disabled = 0 
    renderXml=false 
    index=windows 

**Note:** CrossRealms has blacklisted the below EventCode from **WinEventLog:Security** (this EventCode’s data consumes a ton of licensing usage and is not necessary for this application).
    
* 5156: The Windows Filtering Platform has allowed a connection  

EventCodes 566 & 4662 should already be blacklisted in the default inputs.conf file for the Windows Add-on. 

Windows EventLog from AD servers (security logs) are only tested in plain text format (see renderXml = false in inputs.conf stanza) in the Cyences App.  

Also, Active Directory related reports/alerts (Group Changes, Group Policy Changes, and User Changes) only works with plain text formatted events. 

## Estimated Data Size
Data size with updated stanzas:

* WinEventLog:Security:  0.8-1.2GB per host per day 

* WinEventLog:System: 0.1-0.3GB per host per day

**Note:** The data provided for **WinEventLog:Security** tends to vary from host to host as a lot of it is based on the overall usage of the system.

## **Windows Active Directory Logs**

Use the Windows Add-on to collect Active Directory related logs (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/AbouttheSplunkAdd-onforWindows).  

This data is required for Active Directory related reports/alerts (Group Changes, Group Policy Changes and User Changes) and it is only compatible with plain text formatted events. 

Enable the input stanzas below for the Splunk Add-on for Windows. Both stanzas are located in the inputs.conf file (create a local directory if necessary): 

    ## Health and Topology Information NT6 
    [script://.\bin\runpowershell.cmd nt6-health.ps1] 
    disabled=0 
    renderXml=false 
    index=msad 

    ## Health and Topology Information 2012r2 and 2016 
    [powershell://AD-Health] 
    disabled = 0 
    renderXml=false 
    index=msad 

    ## Active Directory (Admon Logs) 
    [admon://<name of stanza>] 
    disabled = 0 
    renderXml = false 
    index = msad 
    targetDc = <The unique name of the domain controller you want to use for AD monitoring.> 

Reference for admon input creation: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/MonitorActiveDirectory 

**Note:** Use **renderXml=false** as field extraction may not work with XML format.

## Estimated Data Size
Data size with updated stanzas: 

* MSAD Health and Active Directory both use < 10 MB per day. 

**Note:** The data size tends to vary based on how large the Active Directory environment is, but generally it consumes very little license usage overall.

## **Microsoft Office 365 Management Activities**
