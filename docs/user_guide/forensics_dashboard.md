# Forensics 
The Forensics dashboard is designed to give security engineers insightful information associated with their security investigation. This is mainly a drilldown dashboard from the Overview dashboard, but it is also useful for finding additional information about the various kinds of alerts Cyences has to offer and their matching descriptions. Select any alert from the dropdown and the Forensics dashboard will provide more information about the alert. 

The dashboard also helps with completing a forensics dashboard regarding a security issue, as it shows pertinent information about the compromised systems and signatures involved in their respective panels. If a Splunk user drilldowns on either of these dashboard panels (Compromised Systems and Signature), it will provide additional details about which other events were involved or where a similar problem is present. A broader way to access these events is to drilldown from the Alert Details dashboard panel to view the activity that was responsible for triggering the alert.
