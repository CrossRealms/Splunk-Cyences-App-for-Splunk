**Note:** Configure the index value `index IN (wineventlog, windows, msad)` for both **WinEventLog Security Data** and **WinEventLog System Data** under the **Data Source Macros** section in Cyences' Configuration page.

### Estimated Data Size
Data size with updated stanzas:
* WinEventLog:Security: 0.8-1.2GB per host per day

**Note:** The data provided for **WinEventLog:Security** tends to vary from host to host as a lot of it is based on the overall usage of the system.
