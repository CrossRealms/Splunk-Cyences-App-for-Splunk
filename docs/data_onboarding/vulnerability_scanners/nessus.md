## Estimated Data Size

The Nessus-Professional Add-on for Splunk does not consume a ton of license usage, since it only collects vulnerability scan related information from all of your devices, but it is contingent on the number of devices and vulnerabilities that are present in your environment. For example, CrossRealms had around 400 devices and the total license consumption was less than 150MB.
