# **Active Directory / Azure Active Directory**

## **Windows Active Directory Data** 

Use the Windows Add-on to collect Active Directory related logs [https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/AbouttheSplunkAdd-onforWindows](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/AbouttheSplunkAdd-onforWindows).

This data is required for Active Directory related alerts/dashboards (Group Changes, Group Policy Changes, and User Changes) and it is only compatible with plain text formatted events. 

Refer to `A-TA-ad_inputs` App on [this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CrossRealms/Cyences-Input-Apps) for inputs.conf reference.

Reference for admon input creation:[https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/MonitorActiveDirectory](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/MonitorActiveDirectory) 


## Estimated Data Size
Data size with updated stanzas: 

* MSAD Health and Active Directory both use < 10 MB per day. 

**Note:** The data size tends to vary based on how large the Active Directory environment is, but generally it consumes very little license usage overall.

## **Microsoft Office 365 Management Activities Data**

The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365 will be required in order to collect management activity data.

        * The index can be renamed, but the default value for this app is o365. 
    * Enable other inputs based on your needs, but in order for Office 365 dashboards to work only the input data for Management Activity is required. 

4. Install the Add-on on the Search Head. 

## Estimated Data Size
It consumes around 80-100MB of license usage per day. 

The total amount of data varies based on the size of your organization (our calculations are based on organizations with around thirty Office 365 users).
