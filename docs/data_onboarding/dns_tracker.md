## **DNS Tracker Data**

Add-ons that have CIM compatibility with the **Network_Resolution** datamodel will also work with Cyences' DNS related alerts and dashboards.

Refer to `A-TA-dns_inputs` App on [this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CrossRealms/Cyences-Input-Apps) for inputs.conf reference for Windows based DNS servers. This is not complete inputs set for DNS.
