## **Qualys Data**

The Qualys Technology Add-on (TA) for Splunk is required to keep track of all the vulnerabilities on the assets/devices.  

Splunkbase Download:

Installation and Configuration Guide: 
[https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-ta-for-splunk.pdf](https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-ta-for-splunk.pdf) 

### Configure account and input

* Open the Qualys Addon setup page and configure Qualys API Server, Username, Password details

[qualys://host_detection]
index = qualys
duration = 0 6 * * *

disabled = 0
```

## Troubleshoot

* If you see "ERROR: API concurrency limit reached.  Must sleep for 300 seconds and try again" error
    * Increase cron schedule to reduce the input frequency. Qualys API has rate limit

## Estimated Data Size

The Qualys Technology Add-on (TA) for Splunk does not consume a ton of license usage since it only collects information regarding vulnerability scans, but it all depends on the number of devices and vulnerabilities that are present in your environment. For example, CrossRealms had around 300 devices and the total license consumption was less than 10MB.
