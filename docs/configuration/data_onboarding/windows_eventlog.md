## **Windows WinEventLog**

View the Splunk Add-on for Windows documentation to learn how to enable Security WinEventLog data (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/AbouttheSplunkAdd-onforWindows). 

Enable the input stanzas below for the Splunk Add-on for Windows. Both stanzas are located in the inputs.conf file (create a local directory if necessary): 

    [WinEventLog://Security] 
    disabled = 0 
    blacklist3 = EventCode="5156" 
    renderXml=false 
    index=windows 

    [WinEventLog://System] 
    disabled = 0 
    renderXml=false 
    index=windows 

**Note:** CrossRealms has blacklisted the below EventCode from **WinEventLog:Security** (this EventCode's data consumes a ton of licensing usage and is not necessary for this application).
    
* 5156: The Windows Filtering Platform has allowed a connection  

EventCodes 566 & 4662 should already be blacklisted in the default inputs.conf file for the Windows Add-on. 

Windows EventLog from AD servers (security logs) are only tested in plain text format (see renderXml = false in inputs.conf stanza) in the Cyences App.  

Also, Active Directory related reports/alerts (Group Changes, Group Policy Changes, and User Changes) only works with plain text formatted events. 

## Estimated Data Size
Data size with updated stanzas:

* WinEventLog:Security:  0.8-1.2GB per host per day 

* WinEventLog:System: 0.1-0.3GB per host per day

**Note:** The data provided for **WinEventLog:Security** tends to vary from host to host as a lot of it is based on the overall usage of the system.
