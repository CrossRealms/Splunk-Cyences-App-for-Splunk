## **Network/Firewall Logs**
View the **Data Onboarding > Palo Alto Firewall Logs** section to see how to collect the network traffic logs from Palo Alto Firewall. 

If your organization is using another firewall network device like Cisco, Meraki, etc. please follow the appropriate Splunk integration (Add-on) steps for data collection purposes.  

Install the relevant Add-on to the search head for field extractions. 

Make sure that the integration that's being used is mapped with the CIM **Network_Traffic** data model.
