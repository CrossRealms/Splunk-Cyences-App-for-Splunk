# Data Onboarding [Admin]

The Cyences App uses data from multiple add-ons and the process for collecting this data will be outlined below. 

**Note:** This data collection process does not cover an end-to-end configuration guide for third party add-ons. For any third-party add-ons, please visit their own configuration guide for complete details. 


--> <TODO-Ahad> - Let's keep this section in the same order as below. We need to re-order the pages to be consistent. We may have to sub page if require.
--> We also need to add page for anything which is missing.
